-interperter that allows you to resolve missing resources at run time

-app that makes a preprocesser that translates custom syntax into C (basically macros?)

-my own JS finite atomata modeler/simulator

-DIY git server on Android?

-make old phones into DIY home security?

-make a better voice assistaint \

-my old idea about a WearOS based universial controller

-wardriving off of WearOS

-Advanced Cheating Techniques using whatever tech I can get my hands on

-download full videos from panopto/youtube/etc the ... brain f script

-literally anything implemented solely using lambda functions and variable references

-a compiler for a language of only lambda functions written in said language
 
-somehow determining what assembly environment?? a binary file is run in
	and therefore being able to make universal apps

compile assembly to C
-and back
-and forth
-and ...

-building a game in assembly language

-creating an error free language
	EVERYTHING is a valid program
	actually kinda interesting
	start with just accepting any file as a valid hello world or something
	then idk maybe metadata like file length has meaning
	maybe if certain sequences show up it can do certain behaveiours
	actually, should meet some minimum requirement for being a capable language
		file i/o
		networking
		display
		... control flow?
			-for everything to be valid, could avoid infinite loops by
				not allowing any kind of recursion 
				and having loop structures be limited in loop count
			-but that would mean I cant have interactive apps?

-build my own database
