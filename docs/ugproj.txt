MVP:
	start page: -XML?
		button for finite automata
	D finite automata:
		can create, name, set initial, set final, and link (with accepted input)
		can simulate it with an input
Need:
- page managment system
- ability to render images
- ability to render text
- abstraction and implementation for creating, rendering, manipulating, DFA
- way to give and run DFA on input

Features:
 1 : save/load automata as JSON or something
 2 : add button for loading
 3 : add instruction for keybindings
 4 : add NFA
 5 : add TM
 6 : make the modelers better
 7 : add ... automata
 8 : make it pretty
 9 : add toolbar menu
10 : add window customization
11 : add Polish language 
12 : make it be able to write the state machine as a C program?
13 : setup programming environment stuff to build on linux etc
14 : see if I can compile it as a portable executable
15 : optimization
