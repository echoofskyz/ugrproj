  created and tested time-stamper
  for project log
< Mon May 15 07:19:09 2023
> Mon May 15 18:29:16 2023
  work on docker container
  using: https://www.makeuseof.com/run-ubuntu-as-docker-container/
  --should make it so that I execute something to open docker-ubuntu shell
    where I use make to compile my stuff
< Mon May 15 19:11:31 2023
> Tue May 16 11:44:42 2023
  got docker container working as it should
  created Makefile
  created hello_world program to test Makefile
< Tue May 16 12:21:04 2023
> Wed May 17 08:10:51 2023
  started defining project structure
< Wed May 17 08:31:39 2023
> Thu May 18 08:39:52 2023
  copied a different project as a template
  set up glwf/linking for both win and linux
< Thu May 18 10:30:07 2023
> Fri May 19 06:39:41 2023
  created shader_man.c/h
  currently provides a function
    to compile shader programs from
    const char*-s that are vertex
    and fragment shaders
< Fri May 19 07:20:05 2023
> Fri May 19 08:43:21 2023
  moved gl/draw stuff to seperate
    start_page file
< Fri May 19 09:42:57 2023
> Sat May 20 10:37:46 2023
  wrote the first version of linked_list.h/c
  hopefully it works
  --should set up unit tests for it
  learned about void pointers
< Sat May 20 11:28:52 2023
> Sun May 21 08:08:32 2023
  started unit tests for linked_list
  lots of re writing
< Sun May 21 09:10:17 2023
> Mon May 22 08:23:18 2023
  added a bunch of test cases
  and fixed some defects
< Mon May 22 10:31:40 2023
> Tue May 23 08:51:37 2023
  finished writing unit tests for
    linked list and fixed all
    defects found
< Tue May 23 09:16:30 2023
> Tue May 23 19:30:20 2023
  added insert and empty methods to linked_list
    need to test
< Tue May 23 19:42:12 2023
> Tue May 23 19:55:39 2023
  decided to rewrite lists
    going to use doubly linked
    lists and include cursor, not going
    to store method pointers in list struct
    making a new singelton Lists or something
    to do things to lists
  got it to the point where it compiles
    haven't yet implemented most of the methods
    implementing different list managers for
    different datatypes that basically just
    wrap the one for void pointers
  learned that extern basically just makes the compiler
    look for when the variable is declared again
    and is defined somewhere else
< Tue May 23 21:43:15 2023
> Wed May 24 07:52:02 2023
  finishd initial implementation of VPLists
    got it to compile, not tested
    need to refactor unit tests to use VPLists
    and add tests for new methods
< Wed May 24 09:03:04 2023
> Thu May 25 07:40:54 2023
  refactored List tests
    to use/test VPLists
  --need to add tests for insert,
    cursor stuff, previous node checks
< Thu May 25 08:23:34 2023
> Thu May 25 10:51:17 2023
  added the rest of the tests for VPLists
< Thu May 25 11:06:15 2023

  tried to design page elements, then Shaders
    planning on makeing a Renderer struct
    and Renderers to interface with them
    need to learn how to render text first
< Thu May 25 16:51:34 2023
> Thu May 25 19:08:08 2023
  wrote Renderer type and
    the skeleton of Renderers
    tried to figure out how to 
    render an ellipse in a frag shader
< Thu May 25 21:07:51 2023
> Fri May 26 13:19:32 2023
  got the new stuff to compile and
    continued to implement Renderers
< Fri May 26 15:23:14 2023
> Sat May 27 08:43:49 2023
  got triangle rendering to work
< Sat May 27 10:02:23 2023
> Sun May 28 12:10:15 2023
  set up draw line
< Sun May 28 13:05:40 2023
> Mon May 29 09:15:38 2023
  set up draw fill rect
< Mon May 29 09:31:25 2023
> Tue May 30 09:39:18 2023
  set up draw stroke rect
    and draw rect
< Tue May 30 09:52:42 2023
> Wed May 31 13:08:29 2023
  started to set up draw/render fill circle
< Wed May 31 13:21:51 2023
> Thu Jun  1 20:11:00 2023
  continued to implement draw fill circle
< Thu Jun  1 20:25:19 2023
> Sat Jun  3 11:56:32 2023
  continued to implement render fill circle
< Sat Jun  3 12:07:25 2023
> Wed Jun  7 14:56:56 2023
  started to write circle frag shader
< Wed Jun  7 15:00:47 2023
> Tue Jun 13 19:16:33 2023
  got the project to compile (needs testing,
    frag shader just solid color)
< Tue Jun 13 19:35:55 2023
> Thu Jul 20 08:34:26 2023
  added renderFillCircles to draw loop
  fixed ShaderUtils error message (was saying 
    vert shader in frag shader err msg)
  changed circle shaders bc vec5 does not exist
  :runs without error, next write circle frag
    shader
  -need to decide how I want to fix aspect ratio
< Thu Jul 20 09:36:29 2023
> Fri Jul 21 12:49:07 2023
  wrote the start of the circle frag shader
  added resolution uniform to circle render
  added width/height property to renderer
  added width/height update to resize callback
  :got a circle to render
  -need to make all circles render
  -will probably fix the aspect ratio maybe 4x3?
< Fri Jul 21 14:05:39 2023
> Sat Jul 22 12:17:29 2023
  circles with different positions works just fine
  enabled blending
  -temporarily removed depth testing to make transparency
    work properly
  :need to re-enable depth testing and render the circles
    seperatly in order of depth so transparency works correctly
< Sat Jul 22 13:02:38 2023
> Mon Jul 24 07:27:13 2023
  rearranged circle rendering to render one at a time
  determined that I should get rid of z coord based
    rendering and do normal 2d order based overlap
  :need to remove z coord from shape objects
  :need to redo rendering functions to render
    objects as they are drawn instead of after
< Mon Jul 24 08:11:31 2023
> Wed Jul 26 17:17:43 2023
  made the project be a git repo
  removed the z coord from everything
  made draw functions render immediately
  changed triangle rendering color passthrough
    to use a uniform instead of a vertex attribute
  got everything to run correctly again
< Wed Jul 26 19:24:21 2023
> Thu Jul 27 17:28:14 2023
  changed the way I get colors into the
    triangle shader to a unifrom instead of
    attribute pointers
  -figured out that the issue where circle 
    rendering wouldn't work was somehow caused
    by seting up the uniform before setting
    the shader to use, no idea why, just followed
    the instructions on khronos' site about
    common errors
    (fixed this)
  changed circle rendering to use uniforms
    instead of vert attrib pointers
